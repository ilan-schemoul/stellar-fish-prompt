Very inspired from gnuykeaj.

# Features

- Asynchronous git status
- Number of git stash
- Git branch (shorten if too long)
- Show if git is dirty (uncommitted files)
- Purple ">" if rebase in progress
- Show current virtual env,
- Red ">" if last command failed
- Folder color can depend if symbolic link points to current folder (optional)

# Async

Git can be a big slow on huge monorepo sometimes. This is async
so it first show prompt without git infos then update the prompt.

## Cache

It caches information so the second time you go to a given path
the last informations about git are loaded. If these information
are out of date they quickly get updated.

## Performances

The first render of the prompt (without git infos) takes 16 ms on my computer.

As it's asynchronous you can start typing after the first render.
The second render of the prompt (with git infos) takes place 55ms after the
beginning (so 39 ms after the first prompt).

# Todo

- Makes this an omf package
